# Block-Games

I created templates for several block games similar to tetris, but with more variety and features. The games can play tetris with any shapes of blocks that fit in a 4X4 grid and on any board shapes and sizes, with any design of walls and obstacles. The blocks can move in any direction: left, right, up or down.

CONTROLS
---------------

Rotate block - Space

pause - P

speed up block drop - hold F

Depending on which direction the block is falling the controls for movement are:

arrow keys, left, right, up or down to move the block left, right, up, or down

The arrow key that points in the same direction of the blocks movement (for example down arrow if block is falling downwards) will immediately drop the block to its fall position.
